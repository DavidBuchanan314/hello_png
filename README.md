# Hello PNG

This repo contains code that accompanies my blog post of the same title: https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/hello-png.html

`hello_png_0.py` is the first example given in the article, resulting in `./samples/out_0.png`, which has the skeleton of a PNG file but contains no valid data.

`hello_png_1.py` is the final example given in the article, resulting in `./samples/out_1.png`, which *should* be a completely valid PNG file, visually identical to `./samples/hello_png_original.png`. It's larger than the original, for reasons outlined in the article.
